🌾 Agri-GenAI Vision — Smart Agriculture Image Analysis

**Overview**

Agri-GenAI Vision is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers and agricultural planners choose the best crop to grow under given environmental conditions.
By analyzing factors such as soil type, temperature, rainfall, humidity, and season, the system uses machine learning and generative AI to predict the most suitable crop and provide helpful insights.

**Objective**

To enable data-driven farming decisions by recommending the most profitable and sustainable crops for a given location — improving yield, reducing risk, and supporting smart agriculture.

**Features**

	•	🌱 Crop Recommendation – Predicts the ideal crop based on user inputs (soil, weather, region, etc.).
	•	📊 AI-based Prediction Model – Uses ML algorithms trained on agricultural datasets.
	•	💬 Generative Insights – Provides smart suggestions and explanations for predictions.
	•	⚡ Modern Web Interface – Fast, responsive UI built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn-ui.
	•	☁ Easy Deployment – Works seamlessly on web or mobile browsers.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

**🧠 How It Works**
 
	1.	User inputs parameters such as soil type, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH value.
	2.	The data is sent to the backend API or ML model.
	3.	The model analyzes the input using trained data.
	4.	The system predicts the crop to cultivate to give beat result in the given condition .
	5.	The AI layer explains why that crop is suitable and provides growing tips.
 
  **Future Enhancements**
  
	•	🌦 Real-time weather API integration
	•	🌍 GPS-based automatic location detection
	•	🪴 Fertilizer and irrigation suggestions
	•	📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) support
